const faqs = [
	{
		question: "Can I deploy Docker Compose apps with Dokploy?",
		answer:
			"Yes. Dokploy supports deploying applications with Docker Compose, which is ideal when your implementation spans multiple services, data stores, and supporting tools. You can deploy a Compose stack as part of your deployment workflows, keep configuration in configuration files, and manage environments without increasing complexity as you scale.",
	},
	{
		question: "Which Git providers can I deploy from?",
		answer:
			"Dokploy integrates seamlessly with popular version control systems and workflows, including GitHub and other git providers such as GitLab, Gitea, Bitbucket, and other Atlassian tools. You can connect repos from these version control systems, automate deployments on code changes, and align deployment workflows with CI/CD practices. If your team already uses GitHub Actions or Atlassian tools, Dokploy fits into that process without forcing a new way of working.",
	},
	{
		question: "Can I deploy from a Docker registry?",
		answer:
			"Yes. You can deploy a Docker image directly from a registry, which is useful when you already build artifacts elsewhere or want tighter control over technologies and build tooling. This approach supports consistent deployments across environments and production, especially when combined with automation and rollback capabilities for safer releases.",
	},
	{
		question: "How do preview deployments work in Dokploy?",
		answer:
			"Preview deployments create environments for testing code changes before they reach production environments. When a pull request or branch updates, Dokploy can trigger automated deployments and deployment workflows so developers can validate functionality, reliability, and security in an isolated environment. This setup supports multiple environments, speeds up testing for new features, and helps teams reduce errors before customers and users see changes in production.",
	},
	{
		question: "What is a deployment platform?",
		answer:
			"A deployment platform helps developers and teams deploy apps and services through a repeatable deployment process. It brings software deployment tools and deployment workflows into one place so you can manage setup, configuration, build, deployment, and infrastructure management from a single dashboard. The goal is speed and reliability: automate routine steps, reduce errors from manual work, and keep production environments secure as applications evolve and ship new features.",
	},
	{
		question:
			"What's the difference between a deployment platform and a software deployment platform?",
		answer:
			"In practice, they overlap. A deployment platform often focuses on the mechanics of deployment tools and infrastructure, while a software deployment platform emphasizes end-to-end software delivery, including CI/CD, continuous integration, and continuous delivery. A software deployment platform typically ties deployment workflows to version control systems, configuration files, and multiple environments, so teams can maintain consistency from development to production, with rollback capabilities when code changes introduce issues.",
	},
	{
		question: "Can I use Dokploy to deploy AI-generated apps?",
		answer:
			"Yes. Dokploy works with code from any source, including apps built or scaffolded by AI coding tools. You deploy using the same Git, Docker, and Compose workflows as any other application—there's no separate process for AI-generated code.",
	},
