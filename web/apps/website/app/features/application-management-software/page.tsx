		question: "What is application performance management software?",
		answer:
			"Application performance management software helps IT teams monitor application health, track resource usage, and identify performance issues before they affect users. Key features typically include real-time monitoring of CPU, memory, disk, and network usage, alongside log access and alerting. Dokploy covers the operational side of application performance management: giving teams live usage data, deployment history, and rollback capabilities from a single dashboard, without requiring specialist expertise or separate tooling.",
	},
	{
		question: "What is the best application management software?",
		answer:
			"The best application management software depends on your business needs, team size, and technical expertise. Enterprise platforms often come with deep integration capabilities and reporting features, but they can require significant investment and a steeper learning curve. Dokploy is built for teams that want operational efficiency without that overhead. It covers the key processes of application management, including monitoring, rollbacks, environment configuration, and scheduled jobs, in a platform you can self-host or run in the cloud so that your IT team can run on your own infrastructure if they want. It\u2019s a strong fit for organizations that want to manage business applications with full control and without vendor lock-in.",
	},
	{
		question: "What is application lifecycle management software?",
		answer:
			"Application lifecycle management (ALM) software supports the full lifecycle of a software application, from requirements and development through deployment, ongoing maintenance, and eventual retirement. It connects strategic planning and business objectives with day-to-day operational execution. Dokploy focuses on the operational slice of that lifecycle\u2014standardizing how applications are deployed, monitored, rolled back, and maintained\u2014which is where most teams experience the most friction. For organizations going through digital transformation or modernization initiatives, having that operational foundation in place is what makes broader lifecycle management sustainable.",
