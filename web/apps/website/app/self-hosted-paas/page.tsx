		question: "What is a self-hosted PaaS?",
		answer: (
			<>
				<p>
					A self-hosted PaaS is a platform as a service that you run on your own
					infrastructure rather than using a managed cloud service. It gives
					developers the same deployment experience—Git-based deploys,
					environment variable management, built-in Docker support, load
					balancing, and database management—but without handing control to a
					third-party cloud provider.
				</p>
				<p className="mt-3">
					Dokploy is an open source PaaS you can install on any server with a
					single command.
				</p>
			</>
		),
	},
	{
		question: "What is the best open source PaaS?",
		answer: (
			<>
				<p>
					The best open source PaaS depends on your team size, technical
					requirements, and how much infrastructure management you want to take
					on.
				</p>
				<p className="mt-3">
					Dokploy is a strong open source PaaS alternative to Heroku and similar
					hosted platforms. It supports application deployment, Docker Compose,
					MySQL and other databases, Heroku Buildpacks, multi-server management,
					and enterprise features like SSO and audit logs.
				</p>
				<p className="mt-3">
					It&apos;s free to self-host, actively maintained, and designed to keep
					ops overhead minimal.
				</p>
			</>
		),
	},
	{
		question: "Is Dokploy really free to self-host?",
		answer: (
			<p>
				Yes. The open source version of Dokploy is free to install and run on
				your own servers. You pay only for the infrastructure you provision,
				meaning no per-seat or per-deployment fees. Dokploy Cloud plans start at
				$4.50 per server per month if you prefer managed uptime.
			</p>
		),
	},
	{
		question: "What's the difference between Dokploy Cloud and self-hosted?",
		answer: (
			<p>
				Both versions are functionally identical. Every feature available in
				self-hosted is also available in Cloud, and vice versa. The difference
				is purely operational: with self-hosted, you manage the Dokploy instance
				itself, including updates and uptime. With Cloud, Dokploy manages the
				control plane for you. Your applications always run on your own servers
				in both cases.
			</p>
		),
	},
	{
		question: "Does Dokploy support multi-tenancy?",
		answer: (
			<p>
				Yes. Dokploy includes multi-tenancy support via organizations and
				projects, with role-based access controls that let you manage
				permissions across teams. Enterprise plans include fine-grained RBAC and
				custom roles for more complex access requirements.
			</p>
		),
	},
	{
		question: "What infrastructure does Dokploy support?",
		answer: (
			<p>
				Dokploy runs on any Linux server—a VPS from any cloud provider, bare
				metal, or even a Raspberry Pi for testing. It uses Docker Swarm for
				container orchestration and Traefik as a reverse proxy, so you get load
				balancing, SSL, and routing out of the box without managing those layers
				yourself.
