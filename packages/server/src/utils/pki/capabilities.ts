 * and `hasCapability`, so there is a single source of truth that both the
 * runtime and the UI can query:
 *
 *   installation.hasCapability("cloud.fleet")
 *
 * Legacy `NOTPLOY_FLAVOR` / `IS_CLOUD` values are only ever *hints*: a protected
 * product's capabilities come from a signed entitlement, never from the
